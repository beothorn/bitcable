# bitcable
A channel for communication paid by computation time or storage (havent decided yet).

A distributed network of servers that exchange discoverability and persistence for computation time.

# The problem  

The big difference between actual social interactions and social medias is reachabilty.  
In our natural environment, you can only talk and listen to people close to you. It is a little bit harder, but still possible, to reach a friend of a friend.  
As you go further, it gets more expensive to reach people you are not familiar. Sending a message for a friend of a friend of a friend and so on is a huge effort.  
Also, relaying a message is hard if there is any cost to it. Digital messages have no information loss, but on our real social interaction, having to remember them and adapting them to the nest person requires some effort.  
This is a natural mechanism that protect us from being reached by big players, be them ad companies or political parties. We used to still get those inputs, but filter and verified by our peers.  
If that was a better or worse, that's debatable. What is fact is modern social media killed this dynamic.  

It is also hard to reach a device on the internet for incoming connections. Our ips change, our devices moves from wifi to wifi and without setting up our routers or another mechanisms, we depend on communicating with external services.  
Maintaining those services cost money, and if they are free, some kind of business needs to be created so this is a profitable activity. Even depending on donations is a fragile business model.  

Of course we ant this for some things, but not for others.  

# The idea  
If we had a trust system, where it is cheap to communicate with a few trusted peers, but expensive to communicate with not so trusted peers, or big hubs, the old "local social interactions" experience could be restored.  
Also, we need some incentive for services that are visible to reroute messges from trusted peers, without intercepting them.  
So we need a trust based system, with incentives to collaborate on reachability and resources like storage and a cost associated with sending messages that increases as the trustiness decreases.
